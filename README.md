# My Dotfiles
Thank Goodness

This is a repo for my dotfiles. It's got stuff for both Bash and Zsh (and with that, of course, Oh-My-Zsh). I'm most likely not using Zsh right, but everything works for me so far, so I guess that's okay.

## To Use
- Clone repo
- Run `bootstrap.sh`
`bootstrap.sh` is pretty buggy ngl, and I really have no incentive to fix it. So it shall remain broken for the rest of time.
